## 1. Site Code Breakdown â€“ How the Arenix Monitoring Dashboard Works

In this section, weâ€™ll walk through the core structure and logic behind the Arenix crowd monitoring and dynamic pricing site. The project is split into two main parts: `crowd.html` for monitoring and `dynamic.html` for pricing. Both share the same `styles.css` for visual consistency.

### ðŸ§  Overall Goal

Our goal was to build an interactive and data-rich UI that can:
- **Monitor real-time crowd activity** using video feeds and live analytics.
- **Adapt ticket pricing** dynamically based on crowd demand and match characteristics.

### `crowd.html` + `crowd.js` â€“ Real-Time Crowd Monitoring

This page displays a live dashboard that tracks crowd flow and density at a stadium. It includes metrics such as **total count**, **alerts**, **incidents**, and **average density per mÂ²**.

Key features:
- Users can toggle between video views (normal, density map, overlay).
- Real-time stats like flow rate and density update every second.
- Alerts and action recommendations are dynamically generated based on simulated data.

The `crowd.js` file powers this experience by:
- Initializing video elements and ensuring seamless playback.
- Creating a live density chart using Chart.js.
- Managing the injection of alert and recommendation content into the DOM.
- Simulating crowd data changes to mimic a real-time monitoring system.

### `dynamic.html` + `dynamic.js` â€“ Dynamic Ticket Pricing

This page handles ticket pricing using a custom formula that factors in:
- **Base price** of the match.
- **Team strength** based on FIFA ratings.
- **Audience attendance**, comparing predicted vs. actual values.
- **Match type**, which adjusts the pricing based on its significance (e.g., finals, group stage).

Key functionalities in `dynamic.js`:
- Real-time calculation of **final ticket prices**.
- A visual chart comparing base prices vs. final prices.
- Component breakdown of the pricing formula.
- Badges showing demand level (High, Low, or Optimal).
- Users can toggle views by day, week, or month, and simulate new prices with a single click.

## ðŸŽ¯ Dynamic Pricing Formula

To determine the final dynamic ticket price, we applied a weighted formula that considers multiple match-specific factors:

$$
\text{Dynamic Price} = \text{Base Price} \times \left( 0.5 + 1.5 \times \frac{TS_n + AT_n + MT_n}{3} \right)
$$

Where:
- **Base Price** is the initial ticket price for a match.
- **TSâ‚™** = Normalized Team Strength (e.g., based on team FIFA ratings).
- **ATâ‚™** = Normalized Audience Attendance (predicted vs. actual).
- **MTâ‚™** = Normalized Match Type (e.g., final, group stage).

This formula dynamically adjusts the base price by applying a multiplier based on the overall "attractiveness" of a match, ensuring pricing reflects demand and context in real time.

### `styles.css` â€“ Design System

The shared CSS file ties the entire front end together with a modern dark theme using purple and blue gradients. We used CSS variables for consistency across cards, tables, progress bars, and badges. The design is also responsive to support mobile devices.

## 2. MAN â€“ Backend Script for Crowd Video Analysis

This backend Python script processes raw stadium footage and generates:
- A **count-labeled video** showing the number of people per frame.
- A **heatmap** showing crowd density visually.
- An **overlay video** blending the original footage with the heatmap.

### ðŸ›  How It Works

1. **Model Initialization:**
   - We used a pre-trained VGG19-based crowd estimation model.
   - Torch is used for inference and OpenCV handles video input/output.

2. **Frame Processing:**
   - Each frame is passed through the model, which produces a density map.
   - Outputs are:
     - A heatmap.
     - An overlay with the original frame.
     - A frame annotated with person count.

3. **Output Generation:**
   - For each input video, the script outputs:
     - `*_count.mp4`: annotated with person count.
     - `*_density.mp4`: raw density heatmap.
     - `*_overlay.mp4`: blended view.
   - All outputs are compressed into a single zip (`crowd_vid4.zip`).

4. **Automation:**
   - The script scans a folder, processes all compatible videos, and handles errors gracefully.
   - A progress bar via `tqdm` keeps users informed throughout the processing.

### Link to the Frontend

The frontend (HTML/JavaScript) loads and displays the processed videos from the backend directly within the monitoring dashboard, making the analytics visually interactive and informative.
